I had to re-design the entire system prompt to force the agent to first \"classify\" user query and then decide when and how to call the tools like the following:\n",

This insight will flag both unanswearable and answearable questions, but we can additionally label answearable questions and track this metric for them. We can also track this metric in general to see if the agent has more successful conversations with added changes to the code base / expanded document collection.\n",

A BM25 retriever is relatively light and we can compare LLM reasoning performance against retriever matches while regression tests."
