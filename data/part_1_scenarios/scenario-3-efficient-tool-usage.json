Information Security Policy:**\n*   **Data Classification:** All ACME data is classified into Public, Internal, and Confidential, with specific handling procedures for each.\n*   **Access Control:** Adheres to the principle of least privilege, ensuring users have unique credentials, and access rights are reviewed quarterly and revoked within 24 hours for terminated employees.\n*   **Compliance Requirements:** ACME maintains compliance with SOC 2 Type II, GDPR, CCPA, and ISO 27001 certification.\n\n**2. Product Security:**\n*   **Security Features in ACME Products:** Products like ACME Analytics feature role-based access control (RBAC), data encryption (at rest and in transit), audit logging, and multi-factor authentication support. ACME Cloud includes network isolation, security groups, firewalls, DDoS protection, and vulnerability scanning.\n*   **Security Incident Response:** A structured process is in place for detecting, containing, notifying the security team, investigating, remediating, and documenting lessons learned from security incidents.\n*   **Penetration Testing:** Annual, full-scope penetration testing is conducted by third-party security firms, with findings remediated within 30 days.\n\n**3. Employee Security Training:**\n*   **Onboarding Security Training:** New employees receive training on password policies, phishing awareness, data handling, and incident reporting.\n*   **Ongoing Training:** Quarterly security awareness updates are provided on the latest threats, security best practices, and compliance requirements.\n\n**4. Physical Security:**\n*   **Office Security:** Measures include badge access, visitor sign-in and escort, security cameras, and after-hours alarm systems.\n*   **Device Security:** Company devices are required to use full-disk encryption, have screen lock enabled, run approved antivirus software, and receive regular security updates.\n\nSource: security-guidelines.mdc",
