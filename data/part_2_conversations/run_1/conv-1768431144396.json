This includes unique user credentials, quarterly review of access rights, and revocation of access for terminated employees within 24 hours.\n*   **Compliance Requirements:** ACME maintains compliance with SOC 2 Type II, GDPR (for European customers), CCPA (for California customers), and ISO 27001 certification.\n\n**Product Security:**\nACME products incorporate enterprise-grade security features such as role-based access control (RBAC), data encryption, audit logging, multi-factor authentication, network isolation, security groups, DDoS protection, and vulnerability scanning. The company also has a security incident response process and conducts annual penetration testing.\n\n**Employee Security Training:**\nNew employees receive onboarding security training covering password policies, phishing awareness, data handling, and incident reporting. Ongoing quarterly security awareness updates are also provided.\n\n**Physical Security:**\nACME offices implement physical security measures like badge access, visitor sign-in, security cameras, and after-hours alarm systems. Company devices are required to use full-disk encryption, screen lock, approved antivirus software, and receive regular security updates.\n\n**Contact Information:**\nFor security concerns or incidents, the Security Team can be reached at security@acme.com, or through the Emergency Hotline: 1-800-ACME-SEC. Incidents should be reported immediately.\n\nSource: security-guidelines.mdc",
